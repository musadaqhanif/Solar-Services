# Solar Service Hero Section Implementation Notes

## Design Decisions

### Video Background Implementation
- Used HTML5 video element with multiple source formats (MP4, WebM) for browser compatibility
- Applied `object-cover` class to ensure video fills the entire container while maintaining aspect ratio
- Added `autoPlay`, `muted`, `loop`, and `playsInline` attributes for optimal user experience
- Implemented fallback poster image for better loading experience

### Dark Overlay
- Applied `bg-black/40` (40% opacity black overlay) as specified in requirements
- This ensures white text and colored buttons have proper contrast and readability
- The overlay is positioned absolutely over the video using `absolute inset-0`

### Color Scheme
- **White text**: Primary headings and content for maximum readability
- **Green buttons**: `bg-green-500` with hover states for primary CTAs
- **Yellow buttons**: `bg-yellow-500` with hover states for secondary actions
- **Green accents**: Used for highlighting key statistics and secondary text

### Responsive Design
- Text scales from `text-4xl` on mobile to `text-6xl` on large screens
- Buttons stack vertically on mobile, horizontally on larger screens
- Statistics grid adapts from 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Video only loads when section is visible using Intersection Observer
- **Progressive Loading**: Videos load in order from smallest to largest file size
- **Preloading**: VideoPreloader component preloads metadata for faster playback
- **Error Handling**: Automatic fallback to next video source if one fails
- **Loading States**: Beautiful loading placeholder with spinner and message
- **Optimized Headers**: Next.js config with proper caching and range requests
- **Video is muted** to allow autoplay (browser requirement)
- **Error handling** for video autoplay failures
- **onLoadedData event** to track video loading state
- **Proper fallback content** for unsupported browsers

### Accessibility
- Proper semantic HTML structure with `<section>` element
- High contrast text with dark overlay
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly content structure

## File Structure
- `src/app/page.js`: Main page component that imports HeroSection
- `src/app/components/HeroSection.js`: Optimized hero component with lazy loading
- `src/app/components/Navbar.js`: Responsive navigation component
- `src/app/components/VideoPreloader.js`: Video preloading component for performance
- `src/app/layout.js`: Root layout with navbar and video preloader integration
- `next.config.mjs`: Optimized configuration for video loading and caching
- Video files in `public/` directory (optimized loading order):
  - `solar-hero-video3.mp4` (2.9MB - smallest, loads first)
  - `solar-hero-video2.mp4` (7.1MB)
  - `solar-hero-video1 .mp4` (8.9MB)
  - `solar-hero-video4.mp4` (12MB - largest, loads last)

## Navbar Implementation Details

### Design Features
- **Clean & Modern**: White background with green text and yellow hover effects
- **Responsive**: Mobile hamburger menu with smooth animations
- **Scroll Effect**: Transparent background becomes semi-transparent with blur on scroll
- **Logo**: Solar-themed icon with company name
- **CTA Button**: "Get Quote" button with green background and yellow hover

### Technical Features
- Fixed positioning with high z-index (z-50)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Mobile menu with click-outside-to-close functionality
- Proper accessibility with ARIA labels
- Next.js Link components for client-side navigation

### Color Scheme
- **Background**: White (`bg-white`) with scroll-based transparency
- **Text**: Green (`text-green-600`) for navigation items
- **Hover**: Yellow (`text-yellow-500`) for hover effects
- **CTA Button**: Green background (`bg-green-500`) with yellow hover (`hover:bg-yellow-500`)

## Next Steps
1. Add actual solar-themed video files to public directory
2. Create additional page sections below hero
3. Implement the pages referenced in navigation (Services, About, Projects, Contact, Quote)
4. Add form functionality for CTAs
5. Implement Firebase integration for backend
6. Add loading states and error boundaries

## Responsiveness Fixes (Latest)

### Mobile Responsiveness Issues Fixed
1. **Text Overlap with Navbar**: 
   - Increased top padding for mobile devices (pt-20 for mobile, pt-24 for small screens)
   - Adjusted sun light image positioning to avoid navbar overlap
   - Reduced sun light image size on mobile (12px mobile, 16px small, 24px large)

2. **Typography Scaling**:
   - **Headings**: Reduced from 4xl to 3xl on mobile, with proper scaling (3xl → 4xl → 5xl → 6xl)
   - **Subtitle**: Reduced from xl to lg on mobile, with proper scaling (lg → xl → 2xl)
   - **Buttons**: Reduced text size and padding for mobile (text-base on mobile, text-lg on larger screens)
   - **Statistics**: Reduced from 4xl to 3xl on mobile, with smaller text labels

3. **Button Improvements**:
   - Made buttons full-width on mobile (w-full sm:w-auto)
   - Reduced padding and gap spacing for mobile
   - Added proper centering for button content
   - Smaller icons on mobile devices

4. **Layout Spacing**:
   - Reduced margins and gaps for mobile devices

5. **Navbar Enhancements**:
   - Reduced logo size on mobile (8x8 on mobile, 10x10 on larger screens)

## Build Process & Fixes (Previous)

### Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: `npm start` failed with "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/prerender-manifest.json'"
- **Root Cause**: Application wasn't built before trying to start production server
- **Solution**: Run `npm run build` before `npm start`

### Dependencies Fixed
1. **Missing critters module**: Installed `critters` package for CSS optimization
2. **ESLint warning**: Fixed React Hook dependency warning in VideoPreloader.js
   - Added `useMemo` to prevent `videoSources` array from changing on every render
   - Added `videoSources` to useEffect dependency array

### Build Process
1. `npm run build` - Creates optimized production build
2. `npm start` - Starts production server (requires build first)
3. `npm run dev` - Starts development server (no build required)

### Current Status
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ Production server starts without errors
✅ ESLint warnings resolved
✅ Video preloading optimized
✅ Visual enhancements implemented
✅ Responsive design improved
✅ Performance optimized
✅ Mobile responsiveness fixed
✅ Text overlap issues resolved

## Firebase Integration (Planned)
- Authentication system
- Firestore database for chat history
- Cloud Functions for server-side logic
- Hosting deployment

## Development Guidelines
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use kebab-case for filenames and URLs
- Enable console.log() for debugging in Firebase Functions
- Add error boundaries and fallback UIs
- Document all functions with comments
- Use TypeScript where possible for type safety
