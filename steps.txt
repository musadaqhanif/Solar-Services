# Solar Service Development Steps

## Phase 1: Hero Section Implementation (Current)

### Step 1: Project Setup Analysis
- Examined existing Next.js project structure
- Identified current page.js and layout.js files
- Determined Tailwind CSS is already configured

### Step 2: Component Architecture Planning
- Decided to create modular component structure
- Created `src/app/components/` directory for reusable components
- Planned HeroSection as the main hero component

### Step 3: Hero Section Implementation
- Created `HeroSection.js` component with video background
- Implemented dark overlay (bg-black/40) for text readability
- Added white text with green/yellow button color scheme
- Included responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Added statistics section with solar-themed metrics

### Step 4: Page Integration
- Updated `page.js` to use the new HeroSection component
- Removed default Next.js template content
- Ensured proper component import and usage

### Step 5: Metadata Updates
- Updated page title to "Solar Service - Power Your Future with Solar Energy"
- Added relevant meta description for SEO
- Maintained proper Next.js metadata structure

### Step 6: Documentation
- Created `notes.txt` with detailed implementation explanations
- Created `steps.txt` for chronological development tracking
- Documented design decisions and technical considerations

### Step 7: Navbar Implementation
- Created responsive Navbar component with clean modern design
- Implemented white background with green text and yellow hover effects
- Added mobile hamburger menu with smooth animations
- Integrated scroll-based background transparency effect
- Added solar-themed logo with company branding
- Included CTA "Get Quote" button in navigation

### Step 8: Layout Integration
- Integrated Navbar into root layout for global navigation
- Updated HeroSection with proper padding to account for fixed navbar
- Ensured proper z-index layering between navbar and hero content
